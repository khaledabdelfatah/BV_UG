Admin users can also interact with certain fields to help train the AI model.</p> Column Name Description Group Statement (CS) Group Categorizes entries under business functions: \u2022 Cost of Services \u2013 Direct costs tied to service delivery.\u2022 Sales &amp; Marketing Expenses \u2013 Costs related to advertising, campaigns, and sales teams.\u2022 General &amp; Admin Expenses \u2013 Overhead and back-office costs. FS Group Financial Statement group that links entries to reporting structures (e.g., Profit &amp; Loss, Balance Sheet). JE Source Source system or module from which the journal entry originated, such as AP (Accounts Payable) or AR (Accounts Receivable). JE Category Classifies the journal entry as Expense, Revenue, or other accounting categories. Helps in analyzing trends by category. Account Account number or name related to the journal entry. Used to track which accounts are frequently affected by anomalies. DimRisks Shows the risk value of the entry: High, Medium, or Low. Helps prioritize reviews. ID Unique system-generated identifier for each journal entry. Useful for tracing and referencing records. GL Code General Ledger code used for accounting and reporting. It maps the entry to the right ledger account. Entry Date Date when the journal entry was recorded into the system. Effective Date Date when the transaction becomes valid from an accounting standpoint. Often used in accrual accounting. Posting Date Date when the entry is posted to the General Ledger and included in financial statements. Batch Name Identifier of the batch that contains the journal entry. Groups related entries for processing. Batch Description Textual description of the batch to provide context on its purpose or contents. JE Header Numeric reference that groups lines of a journal entry. Acts as a high-level identifier for a journal entry block. Journal Name Full title of the journal or ledger book where the entry is stored (e.g., \u201cVendor Invoices \u2013 March\u201d). JE Description Short text describing the purpose or context of the journal entry. Helps reviewers understand the reason for the transaction. Line Number Line index in a multi-line journal entry. Important for entries with multiple accounts affected. Debit The amount being debited (increased in assets/expenses or decreased in liabilities/equity). Credit The amount being credited (increased in liabilities/equity or decreased in assets). Anomaly Reason Reason given by the AI model explaining why this entry was flagged (e.g., value outlier, unusual account combination). Response Correction** Displays \u201cYes\u201d if the entry is flagged by the AI model. Admin users can set this to \u201cNo\u201d if the entry is considered valid. This feedback helps the model improve. Response Correction Admin-only field that allows selecting the correct reason for the anomaly from a dropdown list. Used for model training and validation. What's the difference between 'Value Rank' and 'Risk Rank'? <ul> <li>Value Rank: Indicates how unusual a value in a journal entry (JE) is compared to typical values. For example, if the usual value is 1,000 but this time it is 10,000, the Value Rank highlights this anomaly (e.g., high, medium, low).</li> <li>Risk Rank: Represents the AI model's assessment of risk, combining multiple factors such as Value Rank, Source Rank, and Category Rank. Anomalies are flagged and displayed on the dashboard based on this ranking.</li> </ul> <p>Only admin users can edit the values of Is Anomaly and Response Correction</p> <p>Regular users can view these fields but cannot make changes. This restriction helps ensure data integrity and proper model feedback.</p>"}]}
