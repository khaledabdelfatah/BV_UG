FS Group Financial Statement group that links entries to reporting structures (e.g., Profit &amp; Loss, Balance Sheet). JE Source Source system or module from which the journal entry originated, such as AP (Accounts Payable) or AR (Accounts Receivable). JE Category Classifies the journal entry as Expense, Revenue, or other accounting categories. Helps in analyzing trends by category. Account Account number or name related to the journal entry. Used to track which accounts are frequently affected by anomalies. DimRisks Shows the risk value of the entry: High, Medium, or Low. Helps prioritize reviews. ID Unique system-generated identifier for each journal entry. Useful for tracing and referencing records. GL Code General Ledger code used for accounting and reporting. It maps the entry to the right ledger account. Entry Date Date when the journal entry was recorded into the system. Effective Date Date when the transaction becomes valid from an accounting standpoint. Often used in accrual accounting. Posting Date Date when the entry is posted to the General Ledger and included in financial statements. Batch Name Identifier of the batch that contains the journal entry. Groups related entries for processing. Batch Description Textual description of the batch to provide context on its purpose or contents. JE Header Numeric reference that groups lines of a journal entry. Acts as a high-level identifier for a journal entry block. Journal Name Full title of the journal or ledger book where the entry is stored (e.g., \u201cVendor Invoices \u2013 March\u201d). JE Description Short text describing the purpose or context of the journal entry. Helps reviewers understand the reason for the transaction. Line Number Line index in a multi-line journal entry.

Credit The amount being credited (increased in liabilities/equity or decreased in assets). Anomaly Reason Reason given by the AI model explaining why this entry was flagged (e.g., value outlier, unusual account combination). Is Anomaly Displays \u201cYes\u201d if the entry is flagged by the AI model. Admin users can set this to \u201cNo\u201d if the entry is considered valid. This feedback helps the model improve.

Accounts can be expanded to view sub-accounts (e.g., Cost of Services, Depreciation). Balance The actual financial value recorded for the selected month (e.g., April 2025). Expressed in SAR. Balance PP (Previous Period) The value recorded for the same account in the prior month (e.g., March 2025). Used for MoM comparison to assess recent changes. Variance PP The difference between the current and previous month's balances: <code>Balance - Balance PP</code>. Positive values may indicate improvement (e.g., increased revenue or reduced costs). Negative values signal deterioration. % of Change PP Percentage difference between current and previous month: <code>(Variance PP / Balance PP) \u00d7 100</code>. Useful for identifying sudden changes. Large negative values are color-coded in red to highlight areas needing attention. Current Balance This column shows the current balance for the selected period (Same as Balance) Balance PY (Previous Year) The value for the same account in the same month of the previous year (e.g., April 2024). Used for YoY comparison to track annual changes. Variance PY The difference between the current balance and last year\u2019s balance: <code>Balance - Balance PY</code>. A positive variance generally indicates improved performance over the year. % of Change PY Percentage difference between current and previous year\u2019s value: <code>(Variance PY / Balance PY) \u00d7 100</code>. This metric reveals long-term trends. <p>Note on Monthly and Yearly Comparisons</p> <ul> <li>Month-over-Month (MoM): Compares financial performance of the current month against the previous month (e.g., April 2025 vs. March 2025). Useful for short-term trend analysis and operational monitoring.</li> <li>Year-over-Year (YoY): Compares the current month\u2019s data against the same month in the prior year (e.g., April 2025 vs. April 2024). Useful for seasonal trend tracking and longer-term performance evaluation.</li> </ul>"}]}
