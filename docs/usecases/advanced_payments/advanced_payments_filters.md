## **Available filters**

The dashboard provides multiple filters to help users narrow down and analyze prepayment data effectively. Each filter supports refined data exploration based on time or specific identifiers.


### **Prepayment**

Enables users to filter the dashboard by a specific prepayment number. By default, all prepayments are included. 

### **Year Prepayment**

Allows selection of one or more years to display prepayments made within the specified timeframe. Useful for annual trend analysis.

### **Month Prepayment**

Lets users filter data by specific months or ranges of months, enabling monthly-level analysis of prepayments.

#### **Day Prepayment**

Provides a filter for selecting one or more specific days, useful for analyzing daily prepayment transactions.

## **Adjusting Invoice and Receipt Thresholds**

The **Days Since Invoice** and **Days Since Receipt** filters allow you to define thresholds for highlighting values in red, helping you quickly identify overdue transactions.

### **Steps to Change Thresholds**

1. **Locate the Threshold Fields**  
    At the top of the dashboard, find the input fields labeled:  
    - **Days Since Last Invoice**  
    - **Days Since Last Receipt**  
    
    These fields are positioned directly below the dashboard title bar.

2. **Enter a New Threshold Value**  
    - Click inside the desired field.  
    - Input the number of days you want as the threshold (e.g., `30`, `90`, `180`, etc.).  
    - Press Enter or click outside the field to apply the new value.

3. **Observe Automatic Updates**  
    Once the new thresholds are set:  
    - The data grid below will refresh automatically.  
    - Rows in the **Prepayment Details** table will be highlighted in red if the **Days Since Invoice** or **Days Since Receipt** exceeds the specified threshold.  
    - Summary charts may also reflect the updated filter settings.

4. **Review Highlighted Records**  
    Red-highlighted cells indicate transactions that exceed the defined thresholds. Use this visual cue to prioritize follow-up actions or reconciliation tasks.

## **Sending Dashboard Data via Email**

The dashboard includes a built-in option to share the current view via email. This feature is useful for notifying stakeholders, sharing insights, or escalating aged transactions.
