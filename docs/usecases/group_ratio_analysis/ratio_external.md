# **Ratio External**

The Ratio External tab enables you to view financial ratios calculated from external data sources, supporting the integration of financial measures from subsidiaries or business units for comprehensive, cross-entity analysis. The dashboard presents this external financial data through interactive tiles that offer clear visualization and robust analysis capabilities.

## **How Data is Loaded**

Data is loaded into the Ratio External dashboard through a structured process that ensures accuracy and consistency. The system pulls data from designated external excel files, which must adhere to specific templates for proper integration.
