# **Push to Clarity**

The **Push to Clarity** tab enables users to transfer finalized ratio data and KPIs from the Group Ratio Analysis model to the Clarity reporting platform. This process ensures that validated performance metrics are consistently shared across business units for organizational reporting.

This interface allows you to:
- Select specific subsidiaries and their associated KPIs for submission.
- Review calculated ratios and KPIs before publishing.
- Push results for a chosen scenario, quarter, and year to Clarity for reporting and dashboard visibility.

Use this tab to ensure that only approved and accurate metrics are published, supporting transparent and consistent reporting across the organization.
