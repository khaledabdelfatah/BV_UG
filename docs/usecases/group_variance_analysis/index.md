# Group Variance Analysis

The **Group Variance Analysis Dashboard** provides a detailed view of financial variances across multiple accounts, enabling users to identify and investigate changes in financial performance. This internal reporting tool sources its data from **HFM (Hyperion Financial Management)**, a financial consolidation and reporting platform.

Designed for the STC Finance team, the dashboard allows comparison of financial data across different periods, accounts, and functions, helping uncover trends, anomalies, and potential root causes.

## **Dashboard Overview**

The dashboard consists of three main tabs:

- **Balance Sheet**
- **Profit and Loss**
- **Source Accounts**

Each tab provides a different level of financial insight, from high-level summaries to granular account details.
