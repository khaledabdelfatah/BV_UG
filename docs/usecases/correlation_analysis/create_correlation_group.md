# **Creating a Correlation Group**

## **Overview**

The **Create Correlation Group** tab is the first step in performing correlation analysis. This interface enables users to define a set of data points—referred to as *correlation items*—to analyze relationships among financial and operational metrics.

These correlation items form a *Correlation Group*, which is later used in subsequent steps to generate correlation charts and conduct in-depth analysis.

### **Field Descriptions**

The table below lists all available fields for defining correlation items. Each field may be **Required** or **Optional** depending on its role in the analysis.

| Field                    | Description                                                                                                                                                        | Required? |

     - A new empty row is available for input.

2. **Add new correlation items.**
    - Fill out each field in the row as needed.
    - Required fields must be completed for the correlation group to be valid.

### Supported Segments (Nine Segments)

The correlation group supports analysis based on the following business segments:

- **Company**
- **Function**
- **Account**
- **Product**
- **Project**
- **Network**
- **Customer**
- **Function Group**
- **Account Group**

These segments provide multi-dimensional flexibility when analyzing financial and operational trends using correlation methods.
