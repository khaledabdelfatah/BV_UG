# **Correlation Analysis Dashboard**

## Overview

The **Correlation Analysis Dashboard** helps users find relationships between different business data points—such as accounts, products, or departments—without needing advanced tools or statistical knowledge.

It’s designed for financial analysts, business planners, and audit teams who want to understand how changes in one area of the business may affect another. For example, if sales increase, does that impact certain costs or accounts? This dashboard makes it easy to explore such questions by guiding users through the analysis process step by step.

With just a few inputs, users can build a group of data points to compare, view a chart that shows how they relate, and review the results. The dashboard also supports collaboration by letting teams share their correlation groups with others.

This dashboard consists of 4 main tabs:

1. **Create Correlation Group**: This tab allows users to create a correlation group by selecting the relevant data points they want to analyze. Users can choose from a variety of financial metrics and dimensions to create a customized correlation group.

2. **Create Correlation Chart**: In this tab, users can select the correlation group they created in the previous tab and generate a correlation chart. This chart visually represents the relationships between the selected data points, making it easier to identify trends and patterns.

3. **Correlation Analysis**: This tab provides a detailed analysis of the correlation chart generated in the previous tab. Users can view statistical measures, to understand the strength and direction of the correlations between the selected data points.

4. **Shared Correlation Groups**: This tab allows users to view and access correlation groups that have been shared with them by other users. This feature promotes collaboration and knowledge sharing among team members.
