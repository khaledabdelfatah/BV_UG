# **Shared Correlation Analysis**

The **Shared Correlation Analysis** tab allows users to view correlation charts that have been shared with them by other team members. This is especially useful for collaboration across departments or between analysts and decision-makers.

Rather than building your own chart, this tab gives you quick access to already-created and shared insights—ready to explore without any setup.

## **How It Works**

Once someone shares a correlation chart with you, it becomes available in this section. The interface and functionality are almost identical to the main **Correlation Analysis** tab, so it’s easy to understand and use.

## **Filters**

### **Year**

Select the target year for analysis:

- **Default**: Specify a particular year for analysis.
  When you select this option, the **Year** field will be enabled for you to enter the desired year.

- **Last Year**: Analyze data from the last 24 months.

!!! danger "Use only the **Default** and **Last Year** options for optimal results. Other options are not recommended."

## **Displayed Charts**

You’ll see three panels just like in the main correlation view:

### 1. **Balance Chart**  
Shows actual monthly values for the selected items (e.g., total building cost, depreciation, etc.).

### 2. **Variance Chart**  
Displays how the value changed from the previous month—helpful for identifying spikes or dips.

### 3. **% of Change Chart**  
Shows the percentage change from one month to the next—useful for evaluating relative growth or decline.

These charts are visually synchronized, making it easier to spot patterns and draw conclusions.



## **Data Table**

Beneath the charts is a detailed data table showing the actual values behind each line in the charts. You can compare monthly figures side by side for each metric in the chart.
